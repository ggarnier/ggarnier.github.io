After a few years maintaining this blog, I decided to start writing in english. I feel like I can reach a wider audience with this. Sometimes when I make a comment in a blog post or github issue, or answer a question in Stack Overflow, I want to link to something I wrote in my blog, but as I wrote in portuguese, I can't do that.

I don't think this is going to be a problem for most developers - at least [I hope so]({% post_url 2009-07-16-livros-tecnicos-traduzidos-nunca-mais %}); if you are a software developer and don't understand english, you should!

Eventually I may write something in portuguese again, if I have a reason for that, so I tagged every old post with [portuguese]({{ '/search/?t=portuguese' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). And every post in english will be tagged with [english]({{ '/search/?t=english' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). I also added direct links in the sidebar, for easy access.
